The vulnerability was found on a page where a user-controlled parameter is reflected
inside an HTML object tag.

By modifying the parameter value, it was observed that the input was inserted into the
"data" attribute of an object element without any sanitization.

Since the object tag allows loading data URIs, it was possible to inject a base64-encoded
HTML payload containing JavaScript code. When the page was loaded, the browser executed
the injected script, resulting in the flag being returned.

This is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability caused by improper handling
of user input.
