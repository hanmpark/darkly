The vulnerability was found on the home page containing multiple images. Only the third
image was wrapped inside an anchor tag that redirects the user to another page.

By inspecting this anchor tag, it was observed that the value of its "src" parameter was
passed to the next page and reused to populate the "data" attribute of an HTML object
element.

After confirming that the value provided in the anchor tag was reflected directly inside
the object tag without sanitization, it was possible to control the content loaded by the
object.

By supplying a data URI containing a base64-encoded HTML payload, JavaScript code was
decoded and executed by the browser. This resulted in the execution of the injected
script and the retrieval of the flag.

This behavior represents a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability caused by
the direct reuse of user-controlled input inside a dangerous HTML context.
