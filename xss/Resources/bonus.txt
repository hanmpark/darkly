This XSS vulnerability occurs because user input is directly reflected into the HTML
content without proper encoding or sanitization.

The application embeds the user-controlled value inside an object tag, which allows
the execution of HTML content provided through data URIs. This enables an attacker to
inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the page.

In real-world applications, XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited to steal session
cookies, perform actions on behalf of users, or compromise accounts.

To prevent this vulnerability, user input must be properly escaped depending on the
HTML context, and dangerous tags such as object should be avoided or strictly restricted.
