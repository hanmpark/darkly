This vulnerability is caused by an incorrect configuration of the web application,
which allows sensitive information to be exposed publicly without access control.

Even though no active exploitation technique is required, information disclosure is
dangerous because attackers can gather valuable data passively. Such information can
be used to understand the application's structure, identify entry points, or prepare
more complex attacks.

In a real-world environment, this type of issue is often the result of forgotten files,
debug resources, or misconfigured web servers.

To prevent this vulnerability, sensitive resources should not be publicly accessible
and must be protected by proper access control or removed from the production environment.
