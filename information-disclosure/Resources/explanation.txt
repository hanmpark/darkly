The vulnerability was found on the password recovery page.

No visible input field was present on the page, but by inspecting the HTML source, a
hidden input field containing a sensitive email address was discovered.

This value could be modified directly by the user and submitted to the server without
any server-side verification. By changing this hidden field, it was possible to retrieve
the flag.

This represents a security issue because hidden inputs are controlled by the client and
must never be trusted to handle sensitive information.
