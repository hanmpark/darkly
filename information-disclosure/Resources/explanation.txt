Sensitive information was accessible without any authentication through a publicly
available resource of the web application.

This information should not be exposed to users, as it can be accessed directly by
anyone knowing or discovering its location.

This represents a security issue because exposing sensitive data may help an attacker
gather information and prepare further attacks.
