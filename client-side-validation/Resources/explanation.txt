The vulnerability was found on the survey page, where a select field restricts the user
to predefined values in the browser.

By manually modifying the value of this field, it was possible to submit an unexpected
value that was accepted by the server and resulted in the flag being returned.

This represents a security issue because client-side restrictions can be bypassed and
must not be trusted without server-side validation.
