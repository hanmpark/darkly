This vulnerability occurs because the application relies on client-side controls, such
as select fields, to restrict user input.

An attacker can easily bypass these controls by modifying the request before it is sent
to the server. If the server does not validate the received value, it may process invalid
or malicious input.

In real-world applications, this can lead to logic bypasses, unauthorized actions, or
unexpected behavior.

To prevent this issue, all user input must be validated server-side, even if it appears
restricted in the user interface.
