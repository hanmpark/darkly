The vulnerability was found in a page parameter that is used by the application to load
files dynamically.

By modifying the "page" parameter and injecting traversal sequences such as "../../",
it was possible to escape the intended directory and access arbitrary files on the
server, including "/etc/passwd", which led to the flag.

This represents a Path Traversal vulnerability, as user-controlled input is used directly
to access files without proper validation or restriction.
