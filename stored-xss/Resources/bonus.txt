This vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting issue caused by the lack of server-side
input sanitization on user-submitted data.

Even if no script execution is visibly triggered, accepting unfiltered input allows
attackers to inject malicious payloads using different HTML or JavaScript vectors.

In real-world applications, stored XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited to steal user
sessions, perform unauthorized actions, or compromise accounts.

To prevent this issue, user input must be properly escaped before being rendered, and
dangerous content should be filtered server-side.
