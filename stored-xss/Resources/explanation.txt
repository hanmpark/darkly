The vulnerability was found on the feedback page, where user input from the name and
message fields is accepted and processed without proper sanitization.

By submitting the keyword "script", it was confirmed that the application does not
filter potentially dangerous input. The server accepts and reflects user input without
validation, which leads to a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.

This represents a security issue because malicious JavaScript code could be injected
and executed in the context of the page.
