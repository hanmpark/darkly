The vulnerability is a cookie tampering issue that allows privilege escalation.

The application stores the admin status in a client-side cookie named "I_am_admin".
Its value is an MD5 hash representing a boolean value (e.g. "false").

By changing this cookie to the MD5 hash of "true", the server considers the user as an
administrator and returns the flag.

This is a security issue because cookies are fully controlled by the client and must
never be trusted for authorization decisions.
