This issue is caused by the application trusting a user-controlled value to build or
select an external resource.

Even if the change is performed in the browser, it changes the HTTP request sent to the
server. An attacker can craft and share a modified link so that any victim who opens it
will send the same manipulated request.

In real applications, this can lead to open redirects (phishing) or abuse of server-side
logic if the parameter is used to choose pages or actions.

To prevent this, the server should validate parameters using an allow-list of accepted
values or use a server-side mapping instead of trusting user input directly.
