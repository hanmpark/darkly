The vulnerability was found in the footer of the page, where links to social media
platforms were present.

The destination of one of these links was controlled by a user-accessible value.
By modifying this value, it was possible to trigger unintended behavior and retrieve
the flag.

This represents a security issue because user-controlled values must not be trusted
without server-side validation.
